##### Human Intelligence

**Human Intelligence** refers to the mental abilities that allow us to:

- Learn from our experiences
- Adapt to new situations
- Understand and work with abstract ideas
- Use knowledge to change and interact with our environment

In simpler terms, human intelligence is what enables us to think, reason, solve problems, and make decisions.

##### Artificial Intelligence

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the term used to describe the intelligence shown by machines. Unlike the natural intelligence of humans and animals, AI is created by humans. It involves:

- Designing machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence
- Examples include understanding language, recognizing images, solving problems, and learning from data

AI aims to mimic human cognitive functions, making machines smarter and more capable of handling complex tasks.

##### Machine Learning

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of AI focused on:

- The study of algorithms (step-by-step procedures)
- Allowing computer programs to improve automatically through experience

Imagine teaching a computer to recognize cats in photos. Initially, you might show it thousands of cat images. Over time, the computer learns to identify cats on its own, even in new photos it hasn't seen before. This process is machine learning in action.

##### Scientific Method

The **Scientific Method** is a systematic way of gaining knowledge that has been crucial in the development of science. It involves:

- Making observations
- Forming a hypothesis (a testable explanation)
- Conducting experiments
- Analyzing results
- Drawing conclusions

This method ensures that scientific findings are reliable and reproducible. In AI, the scientific method helps researchers develop and test new algorithms and models.

#### Connecting the Dots

Understanding these definitions is the first step in exploring the broader field of AI. Here's how these concepts interconnect:

- **Human Intelligence** inspires the creation of **Artificial Intelligence**.
