## 1. An Introduction to AI and Historical Development


### 1.1 Identify the key definitions of essential AI terms.


**a. Human Intelligence**

> *“The mental quality that consists of the abilities to learn from experience, adapt to new situations, understand and handle abstract concepts, and use knowledge to manipulate one’s environment.”*

**b. Artificial Intelligence (AI)**

> *“Intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other animals.”*

**c. Machine Learning (ML)**

> *“The study of computer algorithms that allow computer programs to automatically improve through experience.”*

**d. Scientific Method**

> *“An empirical method for acquiring knowledge that has characterized the development of science.”*

#### Guidance

**b. Dartmouth Conference (1956)**

> Widely recognized as the **birthplace of Artificial Intelligence** as an academic discipline, where the term "Artificial Intelligence" was first coined.

**c. AI Winters**

> Periods of reduced funding and interest in AI:
>
> * **First AI Winter (1974–1980)**
> * **Second AI Winter (1987–1993)**
>   Caused by unmet expectations and limited progress in AI research.

**d. Big Data and the Internet of Things (IoT)**

> Refers to the **explosion of data** from diverse sources such as:
>

### 1.3 Describe Different Types of AI



* **1.3 Describe different types of AI.**

#### Indicative Content

**a. Narrow/Weak AI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence – ANI)**

**Examples include:**

* **Image recognition**: Identifying objects or patterns in images (e.g., cancer detection in radiology).
* **Speech recognition**: Converting spoken language into text (e.g., dictation software).
* **Language translation**: Translating text between languages (e.g., Google Translate).
* **Virtual assistants**: Task-based support (e.g., Siri, Alexa).

**b. General/Strong AI (Artificial General Intelligence – AGI)**

> A **hypothetical form of AI** that aims to **replicate human cognitive abilities**. AGI would be capable of understanding, learning, and applying knowledge across a wide range of tasks — **just like a human**.

**Key characteristics:**

* Not yet realized in practice.
* Can **generalize knowledge** from one domain to another.
* Would be able to **think abstractly, plan, and reason**.

#### Guidance

You should be able to **explain the difference** between **Narrow AI** and **General AI**, and provide **real-world examples** where applicable. Understanding their **capabilities, limitations, and roles in society** is essential:

* **Narrow AI**: Powerful within limits, widely deployed today.
* **General AI**: Still theoretical, but the focus of future research and ethical debate.

### 1.4 Explain the Impact of AI on Society



* **1.4 Explain the impact of AI on society.**

#### Indicative Content

**a. Ethical Principles**

> You should understand the foundational ethical frameworks that guide AI development and use:

* **Floridi & Cowls' Principles**:

  * **Beneficence** – promote well-being.
  * **Non-maleficence** – avoid harm.
  * **Autonomy** – respect human agency.
  * **Justice** – ensure fairness and equity.
  * **Explicability** – support transparency and clarity.

* **AI UK Principles**:

  * **Safety, security, and robustness**
  * **Transparency and explainability**

* **Data privacy and surveillance**
* **Digital inclusion and access to AI-driven services**

**c. Economic Impact**

> AI drives both disruption and innovation:

* Job displacement due to automation
* Growth of new tech sectors
* Shift toward digital skills and AI literacy

**d. Environmental Impact**

> Significant resource demands of AI systems:

* **Energy consumption** (especially for training large models)
* **Water usage** for cooling and electricity generation

**e. UN 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**

> AI can support and challenge these goals:

* **Positive contributions**: education, healthcare, climate action
* **Risks**: inequality, environmental strain if misused

**f. EU AI Act (2024)**

> Europe's regulatory framework aims to:

* Classify AI systems by risk
* Ensure **transparency**, **safety**, and **fundamental rights**
* Enforce obligations for **high-risk AI systems**

**g. ISO 42001**
